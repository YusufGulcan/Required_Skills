# Required_Skills

As a data agent in a highly technical industry, I am interested in uncovering the most in-demand skills within the data industry. With time and effort being finite resources, it is essential to ensure that one is taking advantage of their skill set to the fullest. In this article, I will give answers to questions such as, “Should I learn Python or R first?” or “Do I need to learn about Cloud Services at all?”

## Process:
The steps of the projects explained below:

**Data Gathering:**
In the initial phase of my project, my focus was on acquiring data. I used the Python Selenium package to collect data from LinkedIn. This involved extracting key information such as the Position Name, Seniority Level, Company Name, Job Description, Location, and the unique page link for each job posting on LinkedIn. Selenium allowed me to automate the process, making data collection efficient.

**Data Wrangling:**
After gathering the data, I had to clean and organize it to prepare it for analysis. I addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and resolved any inconsistencies in the dataset. Additionally, I created new features or variables to improve the quality of my analysis. This step involved tasks like data aggregation, categorization, and variable transformation.

**Analysis:**
With a well-prepared dataset, I proceeded to the analysis phase. I utilized the Apriori machine learning algorithm, which is commonly used for association rule mining, to uncover relationships and patterns among job requirements and attributes. This allowed me to identify dependencies between variables like job positions, seniority levels, and sought-after skills. The goal was to extract valuable insights from the data.

**Visualization:**
To effectively communicate my findings, I turned to Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization. These tools helped me create visually appealing charts, graphs, and plots that made my results easy to understand. Visualization not only enhanced the comprehension of my analysis but also facilitated decision-making.

**Insights:**
In the final stage of my project, I presented key insights derived from the data analysis. These insights are essential for stakeholders, as they provide information on topics such as the most in-demand job positions, preferred seniority levels, top skills required, and geographic regions with abundant job opportunities. These insights are actionable and can guide decision-makers in areas like job recruitment, career choices, and market strategies.

In summary, I followed a structured workflow, starting with data collection, followed by data preparation, analysis, visualization, and finally, the presentation of valuable insights. Each phase played a critical role in ensuring the success of my project and its ability to deliver meaningful information to the intended audience.

### Take Away Points:

- Entry-level employees are precluded from undertaking more complex tasks like machine learning modeling when compared to positions requiring more experience.
- Jobs related to R and SQL are more commonly done by entry-level agents, whereas seasoned data scientists are expected to have proficiency in Neural Network-related terms such as Tensorflow and NLP.
- Python, machine learning, and SQL are essential for data science at all experience levels; without these three skills, it is almost impossible to land a job as a data scientist.
- AWS proficiency is demanded more than Azure proficiency by companies, whereas Google Cloud is the least demanded cloud computing technology.
- When it comes to data visualization, Tableau is more popular among companies in the U.S. than PowerBI.
- Entry-level agents are more likely to be asked for a Ph.D. degree than experienced agents.
