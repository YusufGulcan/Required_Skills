# Required_Skills

As a data agent in a highly technical industry, I am interested in uncovering the most in-demand skills within the data industry. With time and effort being finite resources, it is essential to ensure that one is taking advantage of their skill set to the fullest. In this article, I will give answers to questions such as, “Should I learn Python or R first?” or “Do I need to learn about Cloud Services at all?”

## Process:
The steps of the projects explained below:

**Data Gathering:** I collected the data from LinkedIn using the Python Selenium package. The data involves Position Name, Seniority Level, Company Name, Job Description, Location, and the page link of each job post on Linkedin.

**Data Wrangling:** I cleaned the data and created new features to make the data appropriate for the analysis.

**Analysis:** I used a simple Apriori machine learning algorithm to find relationships among the requirements.

**Visualization:** In order to show the results effectively, I used Python Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.

**Insights:** I highlighted some insights based on the data.

### Take Away Points:

- Entry-level employees are precluded from undertaking more complex tasks like machine learning modeling when compared to positions requiring more experience.
- Jobs related to R and SQL are more commonly done by entry-level agents, whereas seasoned data scientists are expected to have proficiency in Neural Network-related terms such as Tensorflow and NLP.
- Python, machine learning, and SQL are essential for data science at all experience levels; without these three skills, it is almost impossible to land a job as a data scientist.
- AWS proficiency is demanded more than Azure proficiency by companies, whereas Google Cloud is the least demanded cloud computing technology.
- When it comes to data visualization, Tableau is more popular among companies in the U.S. than PowerBI.
- Entry-level agents are more likely to be asked for a Ph.D. degree than experienced agents.
